# About

This is a program that is used to tabulate the results of elections of various election types such as CPL and OPL. This project was created by Connell Hagen (me), Michael Mulhall, Khalid Qasim, and Grant Oie during our Software Engineering I (CSCI 5801) class at the University of Minnesota, spring 2024.

`/Project1` was the first portion of the semester, where we create the first part of our project using the Waterfall framework. We made a Software Requirements Specifications document (in `/SRS`), and a Software Design Document (in `/SDD`). We then used our design and programmed the our system to work to tabulate elections for the CPL and OPL election types.

`/Project2` was for the last 2 weeks of the semester, where we used a single 2 week sprint of Agile Scrum to add new features to our program. We added features including the MPO and MV election types, as well as the ability to use multiple ballots file at once for the same election.
